<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My Journey into Web Development</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Tosia, a former IT engineer with a background in teleinformatics,
  currently navigating the world of web development — and motherhood. I used to
  design and implement large-scale systems for monitoring network
  infrastructure, and I loved the mix of logic, planning, and problem-solving.
  Now, as I take care of my 4-month-old daughter, I’ve found a new spark:
  frontend development.
</p>

<p>
  What started as simple curiosity (and a bit of jealousy over my husband’s
  JavaScript skills!) quickly turned into a full-on passion. I’m currently
  working through Dr. Angela Yu’s Web Development Bootcamp and discovering how
  exciting it is to build things from scratch — to see ideas come to life in the
  browser.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I love playing board games, and I dream of one day creating
  my own — maybe even a web-based version. For me, coding is more than just a
  career shift. It’s a creative outlet, a mental challenge, and a space where I
  can grow at my own pace.
</p>
<p>
  I’m excited to share my journey with you and hopefully inspire others to
  explore the world of web development. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just
  starting out, I believe there’s always something new to learn and create.
  Let’s embark on this adventure together!
